                <p class="lead">For 2 years I have been developing this patcher as an alternative to other patchers to innovate a little, however the patcher will stop receiving new patchers and updates from this September 1st, 2024 this is because the hex patchers have become obsolete before the json patches and also I have not been able to constantly update the patcher because I am a person who has been busy with personal projects lately. Thank you very much for all the support received, maybe not many have used this patcher, anyway if you want to continue using it for SEGA games or other companies, click the button.</p>
